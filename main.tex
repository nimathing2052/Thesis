\begin{abstract}
Nepal’s 2022 elections marked a turning point in political communication, with social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok emerging as a powerful tool for political engagement amid widespread youth disillusionment with traditional parties. Beyond mere platform adoption, virality on TikTok—measured through likes, shares, and comments—became a crucial mechanism for amplifying political narratives and shaping public discourse. 

Despite TikTok’s growing influence, little research has systematically examined how political content achieves virality on the platform, particularly in low-income, multilingual democracies like Nepal. Understanding and predicting virality is not only methodologically innovative—leveraging multimodal machine learning on audio, image, and text data—but also critical for unpacking how digital spaces shape electoral dynamics.

This study analyzes 2,964 political TikTok videos accessed via TikTok’s Research API, applying machine learning (XGBoost) and statistical modeling (OLS regression) to predict engagement outcomes. The XGBoost model achieved approximately 60\% accuracy, identifying sender characteristics as key predictors (mean $|\text{SHAP}| \approx 0.4$), while also revealing algorithmic biases favoring established creators, raising equity concerns. Furthermore, communication styles such as humor and charismatic leadership, particularly when tied to independent political narratives, significantly boosted virality, reflecting Nepal’s culturally diverse digital landscape.

The research provides an open-source multi-modal virality prediction pipeline, operationalized engagement metrics, and a cross-platform framework adaptable to platforms like YouTube Shorts. It offers critical insights for political strategists and policymakers aiming to promote equitable online political discourse and strengthen democratic participation in emerging digital democracies like Nepal.

\chapter{Introduction}
Nepal’s 2022 local and provincial elections (2079 B.S.) marked a significant shift in the landscape of political communication, with TikTok emerging as a prominent platform alongside more established channels such as Facebook and YouTube \parencite{nepalitimes2025}. These platforms increasingly competed for influence, effectively cannibalizing attention and engagement from traditional media as political parties sought to expand their digital reach. One of the most notable developments was the growing use of these platforms as agenda-setting tools, particularly in mobilizing and engaging the country’s youth amid rising disillusionment with legacy political structures \parencite{FPExplainers2024, dahal2023influence}.

Nepal's local election cycle (prior to provincial/federal election), social media platforms, particularly TikTok, significantly amplified grassroots movements and youth-driven political narratives. Independent candidates, such as Balendra Shah (Balen Shah), capitalized on this shift, leveraging platforms to bypass traditional media and party structures \parencite{DW2022NepalElections}. The ``lauro'' (stick) hashtag, symbolizing the independent movement, gained traction, mobilizing voter support \parencite{AnnapurnaExpress2022}. Influential creators like ``Routine of Nepal Banda,'' with over 1 million TikTok followers, further boosted visibility for new generation candidates \parencite{dahal2023influence}. This new information ecosystem culminated in the unexpected victory of Balen Shah, a rapper without formal political experience, who secured the Kathmandu mayoral seat with 38.6\% of the vote, outpacing major party candidates \parencite{wikipedia2022local}. While three big traditional parties - Nepali Congress and Communist Parties (CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre) retained dominance overall, alongside their existing visibility on legacy network and social media campaigns, independent candidates, particularly  Balen Shah gained significant visibility on these platforms, mobilizing youth and reshaping public perception outside traditional political frameworks \parencite{DW2022NepalElections}.
\newpage
TikTok's unique affordances, such as its algorithmic exposure of low-view videos, its automated "for You" page curation, and its built-in creative tools - has separated it from other legacy platforms that rely heavily on pre-existing networks or paid-content promotion \parencite{guinaudeau2022fifteen}. The centrality of TikTok’s algorithm in enabling ``virality-from-nowhere''—unexpected viral success regardless of a creator’s status or affiliation—fundamentally reshapes political communication during elections \parencite{guinaudeau2022fifteen}. As a participatory and remixable platform, TikTok fosters an environment where influence is unpredictable, allowing anyone, from independent candidates to ordinary citizens, to become a political messenger \parencite{guinaudeau2022fifteen}. As global industries have adapted to this logic, even some top Nepalese politicians have also started to engage with TikTok as communicative campaigning tool \parencite{himalayantimes2025oli}. This shift has enabled their followers to adopt and innvoate within a distinctly local stlye of political  messaging - one that often blends politcal content with cultural expressions such as mimicry, humor, and entertainment. This practices align with communication styles like "Comedic" category analysed in this study \parencite{umansky2023dances}. 

However, despite TikTok’s rich metadata and increasing API accessibility \parencite{tiktokResearchAPI2025}, there has been little research examining the factors driving political virality through a multi-modal lens. TikTok’s role in Nepal—a low-income, multilingual nation with a history of political volatility—remains largely underexplored as a politican communication tool, particularly following its controversial ban in 2023 and reinstatement in 2024 due to concerns over misinformation and digital governance \parencite{lamichhane2024tik, reuters2024tiktok}. In the context of Nepal’s evolving digital democracy, addressing this research gap is essential to understand virality and its association with several forms of TikTok communication forms   during electoral periods. 

This study offers three key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Academic}: It provides a novel and open-source codebase for multimodal virality analysis, filling a gap in computational political communication research in Nepal.
    \item \textbf{Methodological}: It operationalizes virality through a weighted engagement score (combining views, likes, comments, shares, collects) and compares machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest) to identify optimal predictive approaches for TikTok data.
\newpage
    \item \textbf{Practical}: By analyzing communication styles, cultural elements, and musical styles (e.g., rap, Nepali folk), it offers actionable insights for political candidates and content creators to enhance audience reach in Nepal’s diverse digital landscape.
\end{itemize}

This research lays the groundwork for future cross-platform virality studies (e.g., TikTok, YouTube Shorts) and provides a framework for candidates to frame election content more effectively, fostering informed digital campaigning in low-income electoral contexts.
\newpage

\chapter{Literature Review}
The rapid rise of social media has reshaped political communication, offering new avenues for voter engagement, agenda-setting, and grassroots mobilization. In Nepal, where traditional media has long dominated electoral discourse \parencite{dahal2023influence}, platforms like TikTok have introduced novel dynamics, particularly during the 2022 local and federal/provincial elections. This literature review synthesizes research on social media’s role in political communication, TikTok’s emergence as a political platform, virality prediction, and the interplay of communication styles and content themes, identifying critical gaps that this study addresses in the context of Nepal’s evolving digital democracy.

\subsection{Social Media and Political Communication}

Social media platforms have transformed political communication by enabling rapid information dissemination, amplifying user-generated content, and fostering direct candidate–voter interactions \parencite{van2013socialmedia}. \parencite{mcgregor2019socialmediaelections} argue that platforms like Facebook and Twitter (now X) play a significant role in agenda-setting, influencing public perceptions of key issues during election cycles. For instance, studies in Western democracies have shown that social media activity can enhance voter mobilization, with increased engagement (e.g., likes, shares) correlating with higher voter turnout in some contexts \parencite{bode2016campaign}. However, findings are mixed, with \parencite{piatak2021does} noting that online engagement does not always translate into electoral success, particularly in regions with limited digital infrastructure.

In Nepal, social media has become a vital space for political expression, especially among youths frustrated with the country’s history of political volatility \parencite{bhandari2024weaponizing}. \parencite{dahal2023influence} highlight that unorganized groups and individual creators played a significant role in shaping public discourse, often amplifying anti-establishment sentiments. However, much of the research on social media in Nepal remains qualitative, focusing on user perceptions rather than systematic, data-driven analyses of engagement dynamics. 

\newpage
\subsection{Virality Prediction on Social Media}

Predicting virality on social media has been a focus of computational social science, with studies identifying key drivers such as content features, platform dynamics, and sender characteristics \parencite{berger2012viral}. \parencite{SahJordan2025DecodingReddit} used multi-modal features (text, images, user metadata) to predict Reddit Meme virality, where certain temporal features and content layout was quite significant. Additional work include an  explored video-based platforms, with \parencite{nisa2021optimizing} applying XGBoost Learning algorithm to predict YouTube video popularity using visual and audio features, however, here popularity is primarily based on view\_counts. Besides, the study also doesn't formally operationalize virality, but rather exponential spread in short time, which may not fully capture overall virality as an distinct phenomenon. However, TikTok-specific studies on virality prediction on large dataset are even scarce, largely due to data access restrictions and relative novelty on opening up its research API.

In political contexts, virality prediction is particularly complex, as engagement often depends on emotional resonance and cultural relevance \parencite{berger2012viral}. \parencite{ingelstam2023populism} discusses in her paper a threshold of 250,000 views for “mildly viral” political content on TikTok, but such metrics lack standardization, especially in non-Western settings like Nepal where audience sizes and engagement patterns differ. Moreover, while TikTok’s Research API have enabled multi-modal analysis in regions like the U.S., EEA, UK or Switzerland \parencite{tiktokResearchAPI2025}, access remains restricted in Nepal, limiting large-scale computational studies. 

\subsection{Communication Styles and Content Themes}

The interplay between communication styles and content themes is a critical driver of engagement on TikTok, particularly in political contexts \parencite{umansky2023dances}. \parencite{schellewald2021communicative} identified styles such as Comedic, Communal, and Meta on TikTok, noting that humorous content often garners higher engagement due to its emotional appeal. In political settings, \parencite{cseri2024masterarbeit} found that styles like Charisma/Leadership—often through personalization and visuals rhetoric elicit higher engagement metrics. Styles like Critique/Frustration also resonate with audiences by amplifying anti-establishment sentiments, a trend observed in Nepal’s 2022 elections \parencite{dahal2023influence}.
\newpage
However, existing code-books for TikTok communication styles \parencite{umansky2023dances} are often Western-centric, lacking cultural specificity for contexts like Nepal. Nepalese political content frequently incorporates local elements, such as mimicry, folk music, and rap, reflecting the country’s linguistic and cultural diversity. For instance, independent candidates like Balen Shah promotional campaign was mostly rap/hiphop to connect with youth voters, blending political themes with entertainment \parencite{menge2022kathmandu}. Despite this, there is no standardized codebook for Nepalese election contexts, nor has research systematically examined how these styles interact with political themes (e.g., support for legacy parties vs. independents) to drive virality. This study addresses this gap by creating a culturally tailored codebook and employing regression analysis to investigate the interactions between communication styles and content themes in TikTok videos from Nepal’s 2022 Local Election.


\chapter{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research_questions}

The study addresses two research questions (RQs):

\begin{enumerate}[label=RQ\arabic*:, leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Can the virality of political TikTok videos be predicted using pre-upload content, platform, and sender characteristics?}
    

    \item \textbf{How do different communication styles and political content themes interact to influence the virality of TikTok videos during Nepal’s local elections?}
    
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Research Design}
This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining machine learning for virality prediction (RQ1) and regression-based content analysis for style–theme interactions (RQ2), to examine TikTok’s role in Nepal’s 2022 local elections. The design leverages multimodal data (text, audio, visual) and platform metadata, integrating computational techniques with political communication theory.

\section{Data Sources and Collection Strategy}
The dataset comprises 28,165 TikTok videos collected from March 15, 2022 (one month before candidacy registration) to May 13, 2022 (election day), capturing the campaign period of Nepal’s 2022 local elections. A hybrid approach was used, combining the Official TikTok Research API, the Unofficial TikTok-Api, and a custom subclass of TikTok-Content-Scraper \parencite{QBukold2025TikTokScraper}. The Official API collected video metadata (e.g., views, likes, shares, hashtags, descriptions) and user metadata (e.g., follower count, verified status) but was limited by quotas (1,000 users/day, 100,000 videos/day). The Unofficial API supplemented user-level data, while the custom scraper captured platform-specific features like \texttt{video\_diversification} labels, duet/stitch behavior, and music metadata.

Videos were collected via hashtag-based searches (e.g., \texttt{\#NepalElection2022}, \texthindi{\#चुनाव}, \texttt{\#LocalElection2022}), adapted from \parencite{pinto2024} (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:keywords}). After removing duplicates and irrelevant content, the final dataset included 28,165 videos. Initial features collected include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform/Engagement Metrics}: Views, likes, shares, comments.
    \item \textbf{User Features}: Follower count, video count, verified status.
    \item \textbf{Content Metadata}: Hashtags, video descriptions, audio metadata.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Features}: Posting timestamps (UTC).
\end{itemize}
The data collection pipeline and schema are illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:data_pipeline} and~\ref{fig:data_schema}, respectively.

\subsection{Sampling}
For multimodal analysis, a stratified sample of 3,000 videos was drawn from the 28,165 videos based on view count percentiles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High-Virality}: $\geq$ 95th percentile ($\geq$ 8,000 views; $\sim$5\% of dataset).
    \item \textbf{Medium-Virality}: 60th to 95th percentile ($\sim$35\% of dataset).
    \item \textbf{Low-Virality}: $\leq$ 60th percentile ($\sim$60\% of dataset).
\end{itemize}
After removing videos that became private or irrelevant, the final sample was 2,964 videos.

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:data_schema}, the dataset is further enriched post-sampling with audio transcripts and image analysis. These additional features, derived through the processing pipeline depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:data_pipeline}, complete the multimodal data collection for the sampled dataset (detailed in the following section).

\section{Feature Engineering}
\subsection{Operationalizing Virality (Dependent Variable)}
While there is no universally accepted standard for measuring virality on TikTok, several research studies and commercial tools have proposed their own metrics and predictive models \parencite{roring2024decoding, SahJordan2025DecodingReddit}. Moreover, no prior research has applied standard virality criteria to TikTok videos in the context of Nepal’s 2022 elections, necessitating a flexible approach to capture its role in shaping public attention. In this study, virality is operationalized as a composite score emphasizing relative audience engagement, prioritizing interaction over raw popularity.
Four \textbf{normalized engagement rates} - like, comment, share, repost, were calculated.

The rates were combined with the logarithm of raw view count to form a \textbf{virality score}, using a weighted formula that emphasizes active user engagement. The final formula is:
\begin{multline}
\text{virality score} = 0.35 \cdot \log(1 + \text{views}) + 0.25 \cdot \log(1 + \text{like rate}) + 0.20 \cdot \\ \log(1 + \text{comment rate}) + 0.15 \cdot \log(1 + \text{share rate}) \\ + 0.05 \cdot \log(1 + \text{collect rate})
\end{multline}
Weightings of (0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.05) were assigned to prioritize active engagement behaviors. To assess the robustness of this approach, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using equal weighting across components. The resulting agreement between the original and equal-weight virality labels was 99.53\%, suggesting strong stability of the classification. Given the exploratory nature of this study and time constraints, weightings were fine-tuned iteratively based on observed distributions without external validation.
The score was transformed into a ternary classification label for RQ1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low Virality (0)}: Bottom third of scores.
    \item \textbf{Moderate Virality (1)}: Middle third.
    \item \textbf{High Virality (2)}: Top third.
\end{itemize}
For RQ2, a log-transformed version of the virality score was used as a continuous regression target to account for its skewed distribution.
\newpage
\section{Multimodal Feature Extraction}

This study extracted multi-modal features from a stratified sample of 2,964 TikTok videos to predict virality. Features were derived from three primary modalities: audio transcripts, video descriptions, and visual frames.

\subsection{Textual Features}
Textual or Content features aim to capture the semantic, emotional, and contextual characteristics of a video’s actual media content. These include both linguistic and visual elements:

\subsubsection{Audio Transcripts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Transcribed using OpenAI’s GPT-4o Whisper API \parencite{OpenAI2024gpt4o}, primarily in Nepali with minor instances of Hindi, Bhojpuri/Maithili, Urdu, and English. Manual corrections added contextual annotations (e.g., \texttt{\{\{Party\_Name\}\} Song}). Transcripts were embedded using the BGE-m3 model \parencite{bge-m3} and reduced via PCA (\texttt{audio\_pca\_0} to \texttt{audio\_pca\_99}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Video Descriptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Video Descriptions}: Language detection via LangDetect \parencite{langdetect} identified 494 English and 2,470 non-English (Romanized Nepali-English, Devanagari) descriptions. Non-English descriptions were translated to English using GPT-4o \parencite{OpenAI2024gpt4o}, preserving hashtags and mentions. Descriptions were embedded with BGE-m3 and reduced via PCA (\texttt{desc\_pca\_*}).

    \begin{verbatim}
    prompt = f"Translate the following text to English but keep all 
    hashtags and mentions (like #nepal, @username) 
    unchanged:\n\n{masked_text}"
    \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\subsection{Visual Features}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Visual Features}: A frame at the 3-second mark was extracted \parencite{TikTokCreative2023}, captioned using GPT-4o Vision API \parencite{OpenAI2024gpt4o}, embedded with BGE-m3, and reduced via PCA (\texttt{image\_pca\_*}).
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Scores}: Extracted for audio, descriptions, and image captions using a pretrained sentiment model.
    \item \textbf{Lexical Features}: Included \texttt{audio\_word\_count}, \texttt{image\_word\_count}, and \texttt{hashtag\_count}.    

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Platform Features}
Platform features refer to platform-mediated affordances and behavioral traces that reflect how users engage with the content:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: \texttt{video\_hour\_npt}, \texttt{video\_dayofweek\_npt}.
    \item \textbf{Metadata}: \texttt{video\_diversification} labels, duet/stitch indicators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sender Features}

Sender features capture the video uploader’s social capital and credibility:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creator Tier Metrics}: A categorical feature, \texttt{creator\_tier}, was derived from follower counts to analyze non-linear effects of audience reach on virality. Using the empirical distribution of follower counts across 2,964 videos (25th percentile: $\approx 983$, 50th: $\approx 2,191$, 75th: $\approx 8,120$, 90th: $\approx 48,740$, 95th: $\approx 108,700$, 99th: $\approx 376,500$), we defined tiers as: Regular ($< 10,000$ followers), Micro Influencer ($10,000–49,999$), Macro Influencer ($50,000–99,999$), and Mega Influencer ($\geq 100,000$). This data-driven approach ensures relevance to Nepal’s 2022 election context and enhances model interpretability.
\newpage
    \item \textbf{Verification Status}: A binary feature, \texttt{author\_verified}, indicates official TikTok verification, reflecting institutional presence or public figure status that may influence platform distribution and audience trust.
    
    \item \textbf{Account Age}: Derived from \texttt{author\_create\_time}, \texttt{author\_days\_on\_platform} measures the creator’s active duration on TikTok, capturing their tenure and experience, which may affect content strategy and reach.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Feature Integration \& Pre-Processing}

Predictor variables from platform metadata, sender attributes, and content modalities were integrated into a unified, model-ready dataset. Numerical features (e.g., follower count, interaction rates like \texttt{like\_rate}, \texttt{comment\_rate}) were z-score normalized for comparability, while categorical variables (e.g., day-of-week) were one-hot encoded. Multimodal embeddings from audio transcripts, image snapshots, and video descriptions were generated using a multilingual transformer model, reduced via PCA, and used in their compact latent form without further scaling, as they already captured normalized semantic similarity.

To prevent label leakage, post-performance variables (\texttt{video\_like\_count}, \texttt{video\_commentcount}, \texttt{video\_sharecount}, and their normalized counterparts \texttt{like\_rate}, \texttt{comment\_rate}, \texttt{share\_rate}, \texttt{collect\_rate}) were excluded, focusing strictly on pre-upload features like content semantics (text, image, audio) and user metadata (e.g., \texttt{creator\_tier}, verification status). This structured predictor matrix ensured consistent model input and enabled nuanced evaluation of content, platform, and sender contributions to virality prediction.
\newpage
\section{Sentence Embedding Model Selection}
We evaluate four sentence embedding models on Nepali election-related texts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LaBSE \parencite{reimers-2019}
    \item paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 (MiniLM-L12) \parencite{paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2}
    \item all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \parencite{all-MiniLM-L6-v2}
    \item BGE-M3 \parencite{bge-m3}
\end{itemize}

BGE-M3 demonstrates multi-lingual capabilities supporting 100+ languages with dense/sparse retrieval \parencite{bge-m3}. The MiniLM variants offer optimized performance for semantic similarity tasks \parencite{reimers-2019}.

Based on evaluation of sentence-embeddings (See Table~\ref{tab:embedding_comparison_appendix}) for 11-pairs of random sentence-text pairs, BGE-m3 was chosen for its more balanced performance in compared to other models. 
\newpage
\section{Analytical Framework}

The analysis addresses the two research questions through two complementary approaches:

\subsection{Machine Learning for Virality Prediction (RQ1)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model, Training, and Validation}: XGBoost was selected as the primary classifier over Random Forest and LightGBM (see Section~\ref{sec:model_selection}). The stratified sample of 2,964 videos was split into 70\% training and 30\% test sets, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
    
    \item \textbf{Explainability and Error Analysis}: SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was applied to XGBoost to interpret feature contributions, where predictions are decomposed as $f(x) = \text{base value} + \sum \text{SHAP values}$, focusing on metadata (e.g., \texttt{user\_like\_count}, \texttt{author\_days\_on\_platform}), visual/audio embeddings (e.g., \texttt{image\_pca\_*}, \texttt{audio\_pca\_*}), and descriptive text features (e.g., \texttt{desc\_pca\_*}, \texttt{sentiment scores}). Potential biases were assessed through qualitative error analysis of misclassified samples.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Analysis for Communication Styles and Political Affiliations (RQ2)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Communication Styles}: Videos were annotated with a revised codebook adapted from \parencite{schellewald2021communicative, umansky2023dances}, categorizing 11 styles, with added Nepal-specific categories (e.g., Entertainment/Song, Charismatic/Leadership Appeal) to reflect cultural context and independent voices \parencite{DW2022NepalElections} (see Appendix~\ref{app:codebook}). Each video received a primary (\texttt{Style\_1}) and secondary (\texttt{Style\_2}) style, but \texttt{Style\_2} was excluded due to limited coverage (40\%) and time constraints.
    
    \item \textbf{Political Affiliations and Annotation}: Audio transcripts were categorized into 17 themes (e.g., campaign songs, comedic sketches) via GPT-4o zero-shot classification, then filtered into four Nepal 2022 election categories: \textit{Nepali Congress}, \textit{UML}, \textit{Maoist}, and \textit{Independent}. Labels were verified using multimodal cues (party symbols, candidate names, slogans, election songs, visuals).
    
    \item \textbf{Regression Modeling and Visualization}: OLS regression analyzed the effect of styles and affiliations on log-transformed, z-scored virality, using \textit{Civic Awareness} as the reference style and \textit{general election content} as the baseline theme, with dummy-encoded variables, assumed homoscedasticity, and 95\% confidence intervals. A heatmap visualized mean z-virality-scores across style–theme pairs.
\end{itemize}

A systematic annotation and validation process ensured the robustness of multimodal features and labels for the XGBoost model (RQ1) and OLS regression (RQ2) using 2,964 TikTok videos from Nepal’s 2022 elections.

\subsection{Audio Transcripts}
A 5\% sample (\(n=148\)) of Nepali audio transcripts (\texttt{audio\_transcript\_np}), converted to PCA embeddings (\texttt{audio\_pca\_*}), was manually validated, achieving 87.2\% accuracy by the primary author and a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.462 (moderate agreement) with a secondary evaluator \parencite{landis1977measurement}. Despite dialectal challenges, embeddings were retained due to their complementary role with image (\texttt{image\_pca\_*}) and description (\texttt{desc\_pca\_*}) embeddings, with \texttt{audio\_pca\_0} showing a mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.3.

\subsection{Video Descriptions}
A 5\% sample (\(n=148\)) of translated video descriptions achieved 98.6\% accuracy, preserving hashtags per best practices \parencite{highfield2016instagrammatics}. These were converted to PCA embeddings (\texttt{desc\_pca\_*}) for the XGBoost model.

\subsection{Image Embeddings}
Image embeddings (\texttt{image\_pca\_*}) were generated using OpenAI’s CLIP API \parencite{radford2021learning}, recognized for high accuracy, and directly used in the XGBoost model without manual validation, with \texttt{image\_pca\_2} showing a mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.1 for high-virality predictions.

\subsection{Style and Content Labels for RQ2}
Three annotators labeled all 2,964 videos for communication styles (\texttt{style\_1\_label}, e.g., Comedic) and content themes (\texttt{content\_label}, e.g., party affiliation) per a predefined codebook. A 150-video sample yielded a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.622 (substantial agreement) for \texttt{style\_1\_label} \parencite{landis1977measurement}, supporting its use in OLS regression. Content labels, derived via zero-shot classification and manually reviewed, lacked formal validation due to resource constraints.

\subsection{Discussion}
Validation confirms reliability, with 98.6\% accuracy for video descriptions and Kappa = 0.622 for style labels, though audio transcripts’ Kappa = 0.462 reflects linguistic challenges. CLIP embeddings align with computer vision standards, and zero-shot content labels were mitigated by manual review. This ensures dataset suitability for modeling virality and style–theme interactions, though future work could improve audio transcription using advanced multilingual NLP fine-tuned for Nepalese social media communication context.

\section{Ethical Considerations}
Data collection complied with TikTok’s privacy policies. No PII was collected. Approval was obtained from the Hertie Data Science Review Board. Dataset limitations and potential biases were transparently reported.

\section{Exploratory Analysis}
Exploratory Analysis was conducted on the full dataset. For Dataset summary (see Table~\ref{tab:dataset_summary})

\subsection{Number of Videos Over Time}
Figure~\ref{fig:tiktok_video_post} illustrates the volume of TikTok videos posted over this time frame. A noticeable rise in content production is observed as the election approaches, peaking sharply on Election Day (May 13, 2022).

\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsection{Post Volume Heat Map}

Figure~\ref{fig:tiktok_heatmap_postcount} reveals that most video posts occur on Fridays, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours. A distinct posting peak is observed at 21:00 (9:00 PM NPT), suggesting that content creators might be strategically timing their posts to maximize visibility and engagement during the end of their weekdays.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Top Keywords in Video Descriptions}

The dataset includes 20,237 unique hashtags extracted from video descriptions. 

After applying a custom stopword filter to remove generic or repetitive terms (e.g., \texttt{fyp, viral, trending}), we generated a word cloud to visualize prominent hashtags. Figure~\ref{fig:wordcloud} reveals Nepali keywords like \textit{chunab} ("election") and \textit{chunablagyo} ("election vibes"), as well as direct references to political campaigns. Note that some Devanagari (Nepali) script tokens are rendered as square boxes due to font encoding limitations.

Table~\ref{fig:top_political_hashtag} lists the 20 most frequently occurring hashtags in the political genre along with their respective counts.

\section{Virality Prediction Results}
This section presents the results for our first research question, which aimed to study virality prediction using pre-upload content, platform, and sender characteristics. To focus on pre-upload features, post-upload engagement metrics (e.g., views, likes) were excluded. Results are organized into model performance, feature importance, ablation study, error analysis, and explainability using SHAP.


\subsection{Model Performance}
\label{sec:model_selection}
To select an appropriate model for predicting TikTok virality, three algorithms were compared: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These models were trained with default parameters on a stratified train-test split (70\% train, 30\% test, n=890 test samples). Random Forest served as a baseline due to its simplicity, while XGBoost and LightGBM were chosen for their advanced gradient boosting capabilities, suitable for high-dimensional datasets with mixed features (numerical, categorical, embeddings). Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro average F1-score, and AUC-ROC (one-vs-rest).

Performance metrics included accuracy, macro F1, and class-specific F1 scores for three virality classes: low (0), mid (1), and high (2). The baseline accuracy for random guessing in a three-class problem is 33.33\%.

The comparison (Table \ref{tab:model_performance}) showed that LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (0.61) and AUC-ROC (0.7972), followed closely by XGBoost (accuracy: 0.60, AUC-ROC: 0.7948), while Random Forest lagged (accuracy: 0.58, AUC-ROC: 0.7526). All models struggled with medium virality (Class 1, F1-scores: 0.48–0.52), but performed well on high virality (Class 2, F1-scores: 0.66–0.68). XGBoost was selected for further optimization due to its competitive performance, suitability with lesser data, robustness to noisy data, and flexibility for hyperparameter tuning (compared to LGB), which offered potential for improvement.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model Comparison Results (Default Parameters)}
\label{tab:model_performance}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Macro Avg F1-score} & \textbf{AUC-ROC (OvR)} \\
\midrule
Random Forest & 0.58 & 0.58 & 0.7526 \\
XGBoost       & 0.60 & 0.60 & 0.7948 \\
LightGBM      & 0.61 & 0.60 & 0.7972 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Performance of the Tuned XGBoost Model}
The tuned XGBoost model was evaluated on the test set (n=890), achieving an accuracy of 0.60, a macro average F1-score of 0.60, and an AUC-ROC of 0.7871, slightly below the default LightGBM (AUC-ROC: 0.7972) but comparable to the default XGBoost (AUC-ROC: 0.7948). Detailed performance metrics are presented in Table~\ref{tab:classification_report_xgboost} 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Classification Report for Tuned XGBoost Model}
\label{tab:classification_report_xgboost}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Class} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-score} & \textbf{Support} \\
\midrule
0 (Low-Viral)     & 0.56 & 0.72 & 0.63 & 294 \\
1 (Mid-Viral)     & 0.53 & 0.49 & 0.51 & 293 \\
2 (High-Viral)    & 0.75 & 0.60 & 0.67 & 303 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Macro Avg}    & 0.61 & 0.60 & 0.60 & 890 \\
\textbf{Weighted Avg} & 0.62 & 0.60 & 0.60 & 890 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The tuned model maintained strong performance for low virality (Class 0, F1-score: 0.63) and high virality (Class 2, F1-score: 0.67), with high recall for Class 0 (0.72) and high precision for Class 2 (0.75). However, it continued to struggle with medium virality (Class 1, F1-score: 0.51), consistent with the baseline models, likely due to overlapping feature distributions in this range. The AUC-ROC of 0.7871 indicates robust discriminative ability across classes, though the slight decrease from the default XGBoost suggests that the tuned parameters may have prioritized balance over maximizing AUC-ROC.
\newpage
\section{Feature Importance Analysis}
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to assess feature importance, measuring the average impact of each feature on the model’s predictions across the three classes on the full test set (n=890). The top 20 features are shown in the SHAP summary plot (Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary}), and mean SHAP values for feature groups are presented in Table~\ref{tab:shap_values}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}


\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Mean SHAP Values for Feature Groups}
    \label{tab:shap_values}
    \begin{tabular}{l S[table-format=1.4]}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Feature Group} & {\textbf{Mean SHAP Value}} \\
        \midrule
        Audio  & 0.0013 \\
        Image  & 0.0010 \\
        Text   & 0.0007 \\
        Sender & 0.0480 \\
        Platform & 0.0004 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sender Characteristics (Mean SHAP: 0.0480)}
Sender features were the dominant predictors, with a mean SHAP value of 0.0480.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{user\_like\_count} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.80): Creators’ total likes strongly predicted high virality (Class 2), reflecting established creators’ influence in Nepal’s 2022 election.
    \item \texttt{video\_count} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.40): Prolific creators’ video counts enhanced algorithmic visibility across all classes.
    \item \texttt{followers} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.3): Follower count and network engagement significantly impacted high virality (Class 2), with a minor effect on low virality (Class 0).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Characteristics}
Content embeddings dominated the top 20 features, though with smaller individual impacts than sender features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{audio\_pca\_0} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.35): The first audio PCA component notably impacted medium virality (Class 1), suggesting semantic audio content (e.g., election messages) drove moderate engagement.
    \item \texttt{image\_pca\_0}, \texttt{image\_pca\_1}, \texttt{image\_pca\_2} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.05--0.2): Multiple image PCA components appeared, showing high influence, primarily image\_pca\_0 for Class 2 (high-viral).
    \item \texttt{desc\_pca\_0} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.1), \texttt{desc\_pca\_3} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.05): Text PCA components from video descriptions affected low and high virality (Classes 0 and 2), highlighting captions’ role.
\end{itemize}
Mean SHAP values were low (audio: 0.0013, image: 0.0010, text: 0.0007) due to PCA reduction (100 components per modality). Sentiment scores (\texttt{clean\_audio\_text\_sent\_*}) had minimal impact, likely distributed across embeddings.
\newpage
\subsection{Platform Characteristics (Mean SHAP: 0.0004)}
Platform features had the smallest impact:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{video\_diversification\_id\_10083.0} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.1): The presence of this diversification ID in the top 10 suggests its moderate association with high virality (Class 2). Although its label was missing from the API (see Table~\ref{tab:diversification_label} for details on diversification IDs and their labels), manual inspection of 30 random videos revealed themes often tied to critical speeches, public debates, and civic awareness during the election, with occasional humor and political satire, aligning with the communication styles in Table~\ref{tab:comm_styles_10083}. The missing label reflects data quality issues noted in the Limitations~\ref{limitation}, such as incomplete video metadata.
    \item \texttt{video\_diversification\_id\_0.0} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.05): The default category (2,274 instances) had a minor effect, mainly for low virality (Class 0).
\end{itemize}
The limited impact of platform features may be attributed to challenges in video description processing, such as empty descriptions or misclassification errors, as discussed in the Limitations section.

\subsection{Local Explanation of a High-Virality Prediction}
A local explanation using a SHAP force plot was conducted for a test sample (index 88, $n=890$, video ID: 7093702566613110043) correctly predicted as high-viral (Class 2) by the tuned XGBoost model. The plot (Figure~\ref{fig:shap_force_plot}) shows feature contributions to the Class 2 prediction, starting from a base log-odds of 0.50 and reaching a final prediction value of 0.71.

    \label{fig:shap_force_plot}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Positive Contributions (Toward Class 2):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Video\_count} = 0.276 (SHAP: +0.276): The creator’s high video count strongly favored high virality (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.5).
    \item \texttt{image\_pca\_2} = 1.004 (SHAP: +1.004): The second image PCA component, tied to visual elements (e.g., news broadcast with airplane inset), boosted the prediction.
    \item \texttt{user\_like\_count} = 0.442 (SHAP: +0.442): The creator’s total likes reinforced high virality (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.8).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Negative Contributions (Against Class 2):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{desc\_pca\_0} = -0.031 (SHAP: -0.031): The video description’s first PCA component (e.g., hashtags like \#Localelections2079) slightly reduced virality likelihood.
    \item \texttt{following} = -0.655 (SHAP: -0.655): The creator’s smaller following count limited virality (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.3).
    \item \texttt{image\_pca\_0} = -0.58 (SHAP: -0.58): The first image PCA component opposed high virality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Error Analysis}
An error analysis was conducted on a stratified test sample ($n=890$) to identify misclassification patterns in the tuned XGBoost model (accuracy: 0.60, AUC-ROC: 0.7871) for ternary virality classification (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high). Three specific cases and a general pattern of class boundary errors were examined to understand the model’s behavior.

\textbf{Case 1: Overprediction of Medium Virality as High}
A medium-viral video (ID: 7095593756967046426, true label: 1) with 2,501 views, 232 likes, 3,161 followers, a creator \texttt{user\_like\_count} of 19,854, and \texttt{Video\_count} of 155 was mispredicted as high-viral (Class 2). The model’s reliance on \texttt{user\_like\_count} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.8) and \texttt{Video\_count} (mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.5), which strongly influence high-virality predictions, likely drove this overprediction, as the creator’s high engagement history overshadowed the video’s moderate engagement metrics.

\textbf{Case 2: Underprediction of High Virality as Medium}
A high-viral video (ID: 7089029999780498715, true label: 2) with 2,820,140 views, 161,239 likes, 2,382 comments, 2,423 shares, 49,400 followers, a \texttt{user\_like\_count} of 1,300,000, and \texttt{Video\_count} of 1,876 was mispredicted as medium-viral (Class 1). Despite exceptionally high engagement metrics, the prediction may have been moderated by content features favoring medium virality (e.g., \texttt{audio\_pca\_0}, mean $|$SHAP$|$ $\approx$ 0.3). Although \texttt{user\_like\_count} and \texttt{Video\_count} strongly support high-virality predictions, the model may struggle to capture the combined effect of extreme engagement values, possibly due to the limited impact of content embeddings (mean SHAP: audio 0.0013, image 0.0010).

\textbf{Case 3: Misclassifications Between Adjacent Classes}
Misclassifications were most frequent between adjacent classes, particularly low (Class 0) and medium (Class 1) virality, with 62\% of Class 1 errors misclassified as Class 0 and 48\% of Class 0 errors as Class 1, highlighting the model’s challenge in distinguishing nuanced engagement levels, as evidenced by the low F1-score for Class 1 (0.51).
\newpage
\section{Communication Styles and Political Content Themes}
To investigate how communication styles and political content themes interact to influence the virality of TikTok videos during Nepal’s local elections, we employed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. The dependent variable was the z-transformed Box-Cox virality score (\( z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} \)), with main effects for communication style and political content theme, their interaction (Style \(\times\) Theme), and control variables including log-transformed follower count, author verification status, and days before election day. Full model output is provided in Appendix~\ref{tab:ols_virality_summary}.

\subsection{Model Performance}
The OLS model explained approximately 21.3\% of the variance in virality (\( R^2 = 0.213 \), Adjusted \( R^2 = 0.187 \)), a reasonable fit given the high behavioral variability in social media data. The model was statistically significant (\( F = 8.029 \), \( p < 1.18e - 48 \)), indicating that communication styles, content themes, and their interactions provide meaningful explanatory power for engagement outcomes. However, the model notes potential multi-collinearity (smallest eigenvalue = 1.58e-27), suggesting caution in interpreting coefficients for highly correlated predictors. 

\subsection{Dataset and Category Inclusion}
The filtered dataset from the sample comprised 1,530 TikTok videos, with political content identified through keyword and theme-based labeling. Five political content categories were included in the analysis, also their name along with their election symbol in Nepali script:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Independent candidates (e.g., Balen Shah \texthindi{लौरो/स्वतन्त्र}) — count: 232
    \item CPN (UML) (\texthindi{सूर्य/एमाले}) — count: 271
    \item Nepali Congress (\texthindi{रुख/काँग्रेस}) — count: 256
    \item CPN (Maoist) (\texthindi{हँसिया हतौडा/माओवादी}) — count: 84
    \item General election-themed content (non-party affiliated) — count: 687
\end{itemize}
\newpage
Non-political categories (e.g., Bhojpuri, Funny, Speech, Patriotic) were excluded from the OLS regression to maintain thematic focus and address class imbalance but were retained for exploratory style distribution analysis to contextualize broader communication strategies. Certain style--theme combinations, such as Comedic--Maoist (\( n = 5 \)), had limited representation, warranting caution in interpreting their coefficients.

Summary statistics (Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}) reveal distinct engagement patterns across content themes. Independent candidate content achieved the highest mean virality ($z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} = 0.4949$) and video comment count (89.94), reflecting strong audience interaction. Maoist content also showed elevated virality ($z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} = 0.1411$) and comments (66.20), though with fewer followers ($-0.0764$). Election-themed content had the lowest virality ($z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} = -0.1256$) and comments (17.85), while Congress and UML content showed negative virality scores ($-0.0740$ and $-0.0790$, respectively). Posting timing varied, with Maoist content posted furthest from election day (mean = 13.85 days) and Election-themed content closest (mean = 7.07 days).

\subsection{Main Effects}
The regression (see Appendix~\ref{tab:ols_virality_main}) revealed significant main effects for content themes and control variables, though communication styles showed limited standalone significance:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Independent candidate content} was positively associated with virality compared to the baseline election-themed content ($\beta = 0.2791$, $p = 0.007$), reflecting strong organic engagement, consistent with its high mean virality (Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}).
    \item \textbf{Control variables}: Larger follower counts ($\beta_{\text{log(followers)}} = 1.0266$, $p < 0.001$) and posting closer to election day ($\beta = 0.0062$, $p = 0.010$) were positively associated with virality. Verified creators showed a negative effect ($\beta = -0.9432$, $p = 0.008$), possibly indicating audience preference for non-verified, grassroots creators.

% \subsection{Interaction Effects}
% Interaction terms highlighted complex dynamics between styles and themes:
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%     \item \textbf{Comedic \(\times\) Independent} showed a significant negative interaction (\( \beta = -2.56 \), \( p < 0.001 \)), suggesting that humor, while effective independently, may reduce virality when paired with Independent candidate messaging, possibly due to audience expectations of authenticity or seriousness.
%     \item \textbf{Civic Awareness \(\times\) Congress} (\( \beta = -1.94 \), \( p = 0.007 \)) and \textbf{Civic Awareness \(\times\) UML} (\( \beta = -1.47 \), \( p = 0.029 \)) exhibited negative interactions, indicating that educational tones may be less engaging for legacy party content, potentially reflecting skepticism among TikTok’s youth audience.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Style--Theme Distribution}
% Exploratory analysis of style--theme distributions revealed strategic content framing by creators (see Fig.~\ref{fig:TikTokComm}):
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%     \item \textbf{Independent candidate content} frequently employed \emph{Charisma/Leadership} (28.4\%) Appeal, often integrating rap or hip-hop (including  form of populism/protest) to blend performance with political branding.
%     \item \textbf{Traditional party content} (UML, Congress, Maoist) predominantly used traditional Nepalese-Folk/Traditional styled \emph{Music/Entertainment} (42--48\%) and \emph{Event Coverage}, featuring campaign songs, rallies, and symbolic imagery of their political party like (Tree/ \texthindi{रुख} or green) for support for Congress.
%     \item \textbf{Funny content} was overwhelmingly \emph{Comedic or Political Satire} (63.7\%), while \emph{Patriotic} and \emph{Speech} content leaned toward \emph{Civic Awareness} and \emph{Critique/Frustration} - includes discussions involving critic towards government, other political parities, or even among their own party members.
%     \item \textbf{Non-political content} (e.g., family vlogs, travel) paired with folk, instrumental, or romantic Nepali pop music, emphasizing cultural and emotional appeal.
% \end{itemize}
% \textit{Please note the dotted red line indicates the separation between the Political Parties Support/Campaign Songs vs. Other Forms of Audio/Content Theme. }

\subsection{Interaction Effects}
Given the consistency of interaction effects with prior analyses, we focus on key findings for brevity. The only significant interaction was \textbf{Critique/Frustration $\times$ UML} ($\beta = 0.8653$, $p = 0.040$), suggesting that critical or frustrated tones resonate with UML content, possibly reflecting audience alignment with critiques of governance. Other interactions, such as Comedic $\times$ Independent or Civic Awareness $\times$ Congress, were not significant in this model, indicating that main effects and control variables drive much of the explained variance.

    \item \textbf{Independent candidate content} frequently employed \emph{Charisma/Leadership} (28.4\%), often integrating rap or hip-hop to blend performance with political branding.
    \item \textbf{Traditional party content} (UML, Congress, Maoist) predominantly used \emph{Music/Entertainment} (42--48\%) and \emph{Event Coverage}, featuring campaign songs, rallies, and symbolic imagery (e.g., Tree/\texthindi{रुख} for Congress).
    \item \textbf{Funny content} was primarily \emph{Comedic or Political Satire} (63.7\%), while \emph{Patriotic} and \emph{Speech} content leaned toward \emph{Civic Awareness} and \emph{Critique/Frustration}.
    \item \textbf{Non-political content} paired with folk, instrumental, or romantic Nepali pop music, emphasizing cultural appeal.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This study examines the predictability of political virality on TikTok during Nepal’s 2022 local election and the interplay of communication styles and political content themes in shaping TikTok engagement (or virality metrics) (RQ2). The findings elucidate the complex dynamics of content, platform, and sender characteristics within a youth-dominated, algorithm-driven social media ecosystem, offering critical insights into digital political communication in a multilingual, politically vibrant context.

\section{Predictability of Political Virality (RQ1)}
\label{sec:rq1_discussion}
The tuned XGBoost classifier achieved an accuracy of 60\%, a macro F1-score of 0.60, and an AUC-ROC of 0.7871, outperforming a random baseline (33.3\%) for the three-class virality prediction task (low, medium, high) on a test set of 890 videos. These results validate the predictive power of pre-upload features—content (audio, image, text embeddings), platform, and sender characteristics.

However, medium virality (Class 1) was challenging, with 62\% of Class 1 errors misclassified as Class 0, reflecting overlapping engagement distributions. Error cases showed biases, such as overprediction for high-profile creators (Case 1, ID: 7095593756967046426) and underprediction for videos with strong engagement but missing comments (Case 2, ID: 7092437819582336283). 

\subsection{Sender Influence and Algorithmic Bias}

Sender characteristics, particularly \texttt{user\_like\_count}, \texttt{Video\_count}, and \texttt{followers} (mean $|\text{SHAP}|$ $\approx$ 0.4), played a significant role in predicting high virality, reflecting TikTok’s bias toward established creators \parencite{bucher2018ifthen}. During Nepal’s 2022 elections, this dynamic amplified the visibility of prominent figures such as independent candidate Balen Shah, whose campaign gained additional momentum through cross-platform promotion, including endorsements from influential pages like Routine of Nepal Banda \parencite{Kandel2024}.
\newpage
The error analysis reveals fairness concerns in the virality prediction model, particularly due to its heavy reliance on sender features like \texttt{user\_like\_count}, which mirrors the design of the \texttt{virality\_score}. This approach tends to favor established creators, as observed in Case 1, where the model over-predicts virality for such accounts. This bias aligns with TikTok’s algorithmic tendency to amplify already visible accounts \parencite{noble2018algorithms}, potentially marginalizing grassroots voices and skewing political discourse during Nepal’s 2022 Local Election. Conversely, TikTok’s unique affordances---such as its ``For You'' curation and ability to surface low-view videos---have been noted to democratize attention by giving every piece of content a chance to reach a broad audience \parencite{guinaudeau2022fifteen}, potentially counteracting some of these biases. However, the limited impact of content embeddings (mean SHAP values: audio 0.0013, image 0.0010) indicates that PCA reduction may have constrained the model’s ability to capture nuanced election-related themes, further complicating the balance between fairness and predictive accuracy.

\subsection{Limits of Predictive Modeling}
The model’s predictive success is tempered by limitations in capturing nuanced social factors, such as cultural authenticity or hyper-local sentiment. The low impact of content embeddings (mean SHAP: audio 0.0013, image 0.0010, text 0.0007) suggests that PCA reduction (100 components) compressed semantic nuances, as seen in the local explanation where \texttt{desc\_pca\_0} negatively impacted prediction. Frequent misclassifications between low and medium virality (62\% of Class 1 errors as Class 0, 48\% of Class 0 as Class 1) reflect overlapping engagement distributions, limiting precision for Class 1. These challenges underscore the difficulty of quantifying context-specific factors in Nepal, such as regional dialects or grassroots sentiment, which are critical to political communication.
\newpage
\section{Style--Theme Interactions in Political Communication (RQ2)}
\label{sec:rq2_discussion}

% \subsection{Style Effects: Humor and Civic Engagement}
% Comedic (\(\beta = 1.87\), \(p = 0.003\)) and Civic Awareness (\(\beta = 1.19\), \(p = 0.037\)) styles were strongly associated with virality, aligning with TikTok’s entertainment-driven logic \parencite{PeñaFernández2022}. Humor’s effectiveness stems from its ability to capture attention in a competitive content ecosystem, while Civic Awareness resonates with Nepal’s youth seeking accessible political education. However, these styles’ impact varied by political theme, reflecting audience expectations and platform dynamics.

% \subsection{Independent Candidates: Virality and Authenticity}
% Content about independent candidates, such as Balen Shah, exhibited higher virality (\(\beta = 1.06\), \(p = 0.028\)) compared to general election themes, reflecting their appeal as anti-establishment alternatives \parencite{NepalNews2024}. A significant negative interaction between Comedic style and Independent candidate content (\(\beta = -2.56\), \(p < 0.001\)) suggests that humor may undermine perceived authenticity, as audiences expect sincerity from independents. This aligns with the local explanation’s negative \texttt{desc\_pca\_0} contribution, where hashtags like \#Localelections2079 did not enhance virality.

% \subsection{Legacy Parties: Challenges of Civic Messaging}
% The OLS regression analysis revealed that Civic Awareness communication styles, when paired with content related to legacy parties such as Congress (\(\beta = -1.94\), \(p = 0.007\)) and UML (\(\beta = -1.47\), \(p = 0.029\)), significantly reduced virality. This negative interaction likely stems from widespread youth skepticism toward established political entities, perceived as emblematic of entrenched governance structures and lacking transformative vision \parencite{Onlinekhabar2022}. TikTok’s predominantly young user base appears to reject didactic or overtly educational tones from legacy parties, favoring instead performative, emotionally engaging, or culturally innovative content, even for serious political discourse \parencite{KarimiFox2023}.

% Heatmap analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:TikTokComm}) revealed that legacy parties, such as Congress and UML, predominantly employed Musical/Entertainment styles, constituting 42--48\% of their content. These styles often featured traditional folk-inspired campaign songs infused with symbolic imagery, such as the Tree emblem for Congress or the Sun for UML. 

% In contrast, independent candidates, notably Balen Shah leveraged Charisma/Leadership styles (28.4\% of their content), drawing on contemporary art forms like rap and hip-hop. Shah’s campaign, amplified by supporters, capitalized on his prior prominence in Nepal’s rap scene to amplify his campaign. Both Shah and another independent candidates, such as Harka Sampang from Dharan (Eastern City in Nepal), effectively employed powerful symbol stick (\textit{lauro} or \texthindi{लौरो} in Nepali), a metaphor evoking support for the elderly and a call to challenge corrupt leadership, which became a symbol of uniting independent voices opposing the traditional parties \parencite{AnnapurnaExpress2022}. Th strategic use of these culturally resonant symbols, alongside modern performative styles, allowed independent candidates to resonate more strongly with younger audiences, reinforcing their position as agents of change.


% \subsection{Connections to RQ1}
% RQ2’s findings complement RQ1’s XGBoost results, where \texttt{video\_diversification\_id\_10083.0} (critical speech, political satire/humor) predicted high virality, aligning with the OLS’s emphasis on Comedic style. Sender features (\texttt{user\_like\_count}, \texttt{followers}) were significant in both models, reinforcing TikTok’s creator bias, but RQ2 highlights content-specific dynamics, such as independents’ appeal, not fully captured by RQ1’s embeddings. The negative interactions in RQ2 (e.g., Civic Awareness with legacy parties) provide a nuanced understanding of why certain content underperforms, extending RQ1’s broader multimodal insights.
% \newpage
% % \section{Broader Implications}
% % \label{sec:implications}

% % The findings across RQ1 and RQ2 yield three key implications for digital political communication:
% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item \textbf{Algorithmic Predictability}: Virality can be forecasted with moderate accuracy, but biases toward established creators limit equitable visibility, reinforcing power structures and necessitating platform interventions.
% %     \item \textbf{Strategic Communication Styles}: Humor and charisma amplify engagement for independent candidates, while legacy parties struggle with youth skepticism, highlighting the need for authentic, culturally resonant messaging.
% %     \item \textbf{Youth-Driven Discourse}: TikTok’s emphasis on performance and authenticity empowers independent movements but risks amplifying populist or misleading content, requiring vigilance to ensure informed political discourse.
% % \end{itemize}
% % These insights are particularly relevant in Nepal, where youth disillusionment fuels demand for novel messaging, but they hold global significance as platforms like TikTok shape political expression worldwide \citep{zulli2020tiktok}.
% \newpage

The OLS regression analysis (Appendix~\ref{tab:ols_virality_summary}) demonstrated that communication styles, political content themes, and control variables shape TikTok virality, offering insights into effective political messaging strategies during Nepal’s 2022 local elections.

\subsection*{Style Effects: Limited Standalone Impact}
Unlike prior analyses, communication styles such as Comedic or Civic Awareness did not show significant main effects in the updated model ($p > 0.05$), suggesting that their influence may be context-dependent or overshadowed by content themes and creator characteristics. This aligns with TikTok’s entertainment-driven logic \parencite{PeñaFernández2022}, where style effectiveness varies by audience expectations and platform dynamics.

\subsection*{Independent Candidates: Virality and Authenticity}
Content about independent candidates, such as Balen Shah, exhibited significantly higher virality ($\beta = 0.2791$, $p = 0.007$) compared to general election themes, consistent with their high mean virality ($z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} = 0.4949$, Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}). This reflects their appeal as anti-establishment alternatives \parencite{NepalNews2024}. The lack of a significant negative interaction with Comedic style (unlike prior models) suggests that humor’s impact on independent content may be less detrimental than previously thought, though Charisma/Leadership styles (28.4\% of content) remain key to their success. Independent candidates leveraged rap and hip-hop, alongside symbols like the stick (\textit{lauro}/\texthindi{लौरो}), to evoke support for change and challenge corrupt leadership \parencite{AnnapurnaExpress2022}.
\newpage
\subsection*{Legacy Parties: Mixed Engagement}
Legacy party content (Congress, UML, Maoist) showed lower virality, with negative mean $z_{bc_{\text{virality}}}$ scores ($-0.0740$, $-0.0790$, and $0.1411$, respectively). The significant interaction between Critique/Frustration and UML content ($\beta = 0.8653$, $p = 0.040$) indicates that critical tones resonate with UML audiences, possibly reflecting dissatisfaction with governance or other party members or collation situation. However, the lack of significant negative interactions with Civic Awareness (unlike prior models) suggests that educational tones may not universally under perform for legacy parties. Heatmap analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:TikTokComm}) confirms that legacy parties rely on Music/Entertainment styles (42--48\%), featuring folk-inspired campaign songs with symbolic imagery (e.g., Tree (Congress), Sun(UML)).

\subsection*{Control Variables: Creator and Timing Effects}
The strong effect of log-transformed follower count ($\beta = 1.0266$, $p < 0.001$) underscores TikTok’s creator bias, where established accounts drive virality. The negative effect of author verification ($\beta = -0.9432$, $p = 0.008$) suggests that non-verified, grassroots creators may resonate more with audiences, aligning with the appeal of independent candidates. Posting closer to election day ($\beta = 0.0062$, $p = 0.010$) also boosted virality, highlighting the importance of timely campaign.

\subsection*{Connections to RQ1}
RQ2’s findings complement RQ1’s XGBoost results, where sender features (\texttt{user\_like\_count}, \texttt{followers}) were key predictors of virality, aligning with the OLS model’s emphasis on log-followers (\(\beta = 1.0266\), \(p < 0.001\)). The significant effect of Independent content in RQ2 (\(\beta = 0.2791\), \(p = 0.007\)) provides content-specific insights not fully captured by RQ1’s embeddings, highlighting the appeal of anti-establishment messaging. The Critique/Frustration x UML interaction (\(\beta = 0.8653\), \(p = 0.040\)) extends RQ1’s findings on critical speech (\texttt{video\_diversification\_id\_10083.0}), revealing nuanced content dynamics. For example, this interaction resonates with the public discourse surrounding UML mayoral candidate Keshav Sthapit, whose critical rhetoric against independent candidate Balen Shah was widely discussed during the 2022 elections \parencite{setopati2025sthapit}, illustrating how critical tones amplified engagement for UML content.


\chapter{Conclusion}
This study investigated TikTok’s role in shaping political engagement during Nepal’s 2022 local elections, addressing two research questions: predicting virality using pre-upload features (RQ1) and analyzing style–theme interactions driving engagement (RQ2). Conducted in a low-income, multilingual context, it bridges a critical gap in computational political communication research, particularly in the Global South.

For RQ1, an XGBoost model leveraging sender characteristics, notably \texttt{user\_like\_count} (mean $\lvert$SHAP$\rvert \approx 0.4$), achieved 60\% accuracy in predicting virality. However, classifying medium-virality content remained challenging due to complex engagement dynamics. TikTok’s algorithm, while amplifying established creators and raising fairness concerns, also democratizes visibility through its ``For You'' curation \parencite{guinaudeau2022fifteen}, complicating virality prediction.

For RQ2, an OLS regression model ($R^2 = 0.213$, $p < 1.18 \times 10^{-48}$) revealed that content about Independent candidates significantly boosted virality ($\beta = 0.2791$, $p = 0.007$), reflecting their appeal as anti-establishment alternatives. This aligns with their high mean virality ($z_{bc_{\text{virality}}} = 0.4949$) and engagement (89.94 comments per video). Communication styles like Charisma/Leadership, often paired with rap and hip-hop, were prevalent in Independent content (28.4\%), leveraging cultural symbols like the stick (\textit{lauro}/\texthindi{लौरो}) to challenge traditional leadership \parencite{AnnapurnaExpress2022}. Legacy party content (e.g., Congress, UML) showed lower virality, though a significant interaction between Critique/Frustration and UML content ($\beta = 0.8653$, $p = 0.040$) suggests critical tones resonate with specific audiences. Creator characteristics, particularly log-transformed follower count ($\beta = 1.0266$, $p < 0.001$), and posting closer to election day ($\beta = 0.0062$, $p = 0.010$) further drove engagement, highlighting the importance of audience reach and timing.
\newpage
These findings suggests TikTok’s transformative impact on Nepal’s digital democracy. Independent candidates, such as Balen Shah, bypassed traditional political structures by leveraging performative styles and culturally resonant symbols, resonating with youth audiences disillusioned with legacy parties \parencite{NepalNews2024}. However, the platform’s bias toward established creators and the potential for populist messaging raise concerns about equitable visibility and responsible digital campaigning. By providing an open-source codebase, virality metrics, and a cross-platform framework, this study equips candidates, policymakers, and researchers to foster informed and equitable political participation in Nepal and similar contexts. Future work should explore strategies to mitigate algorithmic biases and ensure diverse voices are amplified, promoting a balanced digital public sphere in the Global South.

\section{Limitations}
\label{limitation}
While this study achieved 60\% predictive accuracy for virality using selected predictor variables, several limitations warrant acknowledgment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Predictor Variables and Sampling}: Time constraints limited processing of the full 28,000-video dataset. Stratified sampling ensured quality, but the subset’s representativeness was not fully validated.

    \item \textbf{Audio Transcripts}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Open AI’s Whisper model struggled with audio mixed with sound effects, retaining only clear segments due to time limitations.
            \item Manual labeling of Nepali text for contextual meanings (e.g., ``party song,'' ``humor'') was applied, but transcripts in other languages (e.g., Urdu, Chinese), slang, or noisy audio posed challenges. Contextual labels (e.g., ``Newari Language,'' ``Bhojpuri/Maithili song'') lacked validation.
            \item Nepal’s linguistic diversity led to language estimation based on the author’s knowledge, reducing transcript accuracy.
            \item Differing audio-video tones (e.g., fun audio vs.\ satirical video) confused RQ2 labeling.
            \item A Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.462 indicates moderate agreement for transcripts \parencite{datatab2025, kolena2025}, reflecting challenges for LLMs in processing low-resource languages like Nepali’s dialects and noisy social media content \parencite{icuc2025, leanmean2023}.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Video Descriptions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Semantic interpretation of Nepali humor, dialects, and mixed Romanized English-Nepali text was challenging. Names like \texthindi{सागर} (Sagar, mistranslated as ``Ocean'') or \texthindi{बसन्ते} (Basante, ``Spring'') in campaign songs required manual correction to capture satirical intent.
            \item Accuracy was assessed on a 5\% sample, potentially unrepresentative of the full dataset.
            \item Empty descriptions and Lang Detect API errors misidentifying mixed text as English skipped translations, affecting embedding accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
\newpage
    \item \textbf{Image Analysis}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Image analysis missed contextual nuances (e.g., running mistaken for walking in screenshots).
            \item Using 3-second clips, inspired by TikTok marketing, lacked academic validation in this context.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Style\_1\_Label}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The custom codebook struggled with blended social media content (e.g., humor, music, vlogging), limiting nuanced meaning capture.
            \item Annotator bias led to subjective categorizations (e.g., rally videos as ``communal'' [Category 4], ``event coverage'' [Category 9], or ``personal vlogging'' [Category 3]). High Cohen’s Kappa ($>0.60$) was sample-based and not standardized for Nepali election contexts.
            \item Communal and event coverage labels were often conflated, as communal themes appeared in documentary-style or rally footage.
            \item Discrepancies between the author’s codebook and annotators were resolved only for significant differences, risking minor inconsistencies.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Content\_Theme}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Zero-shot labeling struggled with humorous multi-party support videos, forcing single-theme selection.
            \item Symbolic imagery (e.g., money in a child’s mouth) was insufficient for clear thematic categorization.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Platform Features}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \texttt{video\_diversification\_id} (e.g., \texttt{id\_10083.0}) had sparse, missing API labels, complicating content type interpretation (Table~\ref{tab:diversification_label}). Overfitting to dominant IDs (e.g., \texttt{video\_diversification\_id\_0.0}) may reduce generalizability for impactful, less frequent IDs influencing high virality (Class 2).
        \end{itemize}
\newpage
    \item \textbf{Transformer Models for Low-Resource Settings}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Open-source models like Wiseyak \parencite{duwal2024domainadaptativecontinuallearninglowresource} and NepaliBERT \parencite{Pudasaini2023NepaliBERT} were limited to Devanagari text, and still surprisingly underperformed on Devanagiri setting, let alone mixed Romanized Nepali-English content. SeamlessM4T \parencite{elbayad2023seamlessm4t, facebookresearch2023seamlessm4t, huggingface2024seamlessm4t} excelled in transliteration and translation than Nepalese fine-tuned counterpart (for Devanagiri). Comparative analysis among these models were not acknowledged due to time constraints.
            \item No Hugging Face model fully addressed transliteration, translation, and semantic embedding for code-switched Nepali-English text. SeamlessM4T-medium handled Devanagari better, but struggled with code-switching, while OpenAI’s API proved more accurate \parencite{reddit2023gpt4nepali}.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Limitations}:

    The TikTok Research API, while enabling access to public data, suffers from archiving delays and incomplete historical records, limiting accurate view and engagement counts for Nepal’s 2022 election videos \parencite{tiktokResearchAPI2025}. As a relatively new API, it offers room for improvement in data reliability and historical access. Additionally, unofficial APIs \parencite{QBukold2025TikTokScraper}, reliant on web-inspect elements, may have some inaccuracies, as manual inspections revealed discrepancies in variables like \texttt{video\_is\_ai\_gc}, where it is null in metadata, but exists in the actual video.
    
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{Future Research}
    Future research could address these limitations by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Scaling to full 28,165 data could provide more finer-grained virality levels and even more nuanced categories.
        \item Developing time-series models to capture evolving virality dynamics across campaign cycles.
        \item Comparing virality patterns across platforms (e.g., Facebook(Meta) platform, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) to assess platform-specific effects. Facebook still continues to be the most dominant social media platform in Nepal, used by half of country's population \parencite{napoleoncat2025}.
        \item Enhancing comment analysis, including sentiment, to better understand virality impact despite time constraints on initial collection.
        \item Employing fine-tuned multilingual embeddings for Nepali and Romanized text to enhance semantic capture.
        \item Using network analysis to explore virality spread, requiring follower graphs and repost chains. While the current TikTok API provides follower and repost counts, it does not include lists of followers or reposters (likely due to privacy restrictions, despite followers being manually viewable), necessitating future API enhancements to enable such analysis.
        \item Exploring hybrid models with attention mechanisms to improve medium virality prediction.
    \end{itemize}

    By addressing these gaps, researchers can further elucidate the role of popular  social media platforms such as TikTok in shaping political communication, particularly in diverse, multilingual contexts like Nepal.

\subsection*{A.4 A Sample Case Study}
\label{app:samplecase}
\textbf{Sample Details:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Virality Score}: 3.6679
    \item \textbf{True/Predicted Label}: 2
    \item \textbf{Content Description}: The video humorously comments on money found aboard a Buddha Air flight, making a political reference to Janardan Sharma during Nepal’s 2022 elections. The audio includes comedic Nepali dialogue, the description uses hashtags (e.g., \#Localelections2079), and visuals resemble a news broadcast with an airplane image inset.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Context and Interpretation}: The video's high virality can be attributed to its comedic tone, political relevance, and active creator profile (evidenced by metrics like \texttt{user\_like\_count} and \texttt{Video\_count}). The model accurately predicted its virality score, consistent with global SHAP findings that highlight the influence of sender features and image embeddings. Description text and network features had more nuanced, secondary effects.

\subsection*{A.5 Development of TikTok Communication Style Codebook}
\label{app:codebook}

This appendix outlines the development and structure of the communication style codebook used to categorize TikTok videos for RQ2 in the analysis of political communication during Nepal’s 2022 Local Elections. The codebook was iteratively refined to capture the nuanced and context-specific nature of TikTok’s political discourse in Nepal, building on established frameworks and empirical observations.

\textbf{Development Process}
The initial codebook was adapted from the communication style classification framework proposed by Umansky and Pipal \parencite{umansky2023dances}, which analyzed political communication on TikTok and included categories such as Comedic, Documentary, Communal, Explanatory, Interactive, Meta, Other, and Not Codeable. This framework provided a theoretical foundation but required adaptation to address the unique characteristics of election-related content in Nepal.

Through an iterative annotation process involving a stratified sample of TikTok videos, the codebook was expanded to incorporate additional styles that emerged as salient in the dataset. These included Musical/Entertainment, Charisma/Leadership Portrayal, Civic Engagement/Awareness, and Populist Critique/Frustration. The refinement process aimed to balance theoretical grounding with inductive insights, ensuring the codebook captured the richness of multimodal political content while remaining practical for annotation. In cases of overlapping styles, annotators prioritized the dominant communicative intent, determined by integrating visual, auditory, and textual cues, as perceived by a typical viewer.

The final codebook, presented in Table~\ref{tab:codebook}, reflects both the adaptation of prior research and context-specific adjustments derived from direct engagement with Nepal’s TikTok political landscape.

\textbf{Codebook Structure}
Table~\ref{tab:codebook} details the communication style codes, their labels, definitions, and illustrative clues observed in video content or transcripts. Each style is designed to encapsulate a distinct mode of political communication, facilitating the analysis of style--theme interactions in the OLS regression model (Appendix~\ref{tab:ols_virality_summary}).
